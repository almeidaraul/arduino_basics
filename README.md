# Arduino basics
This repository is where I'm going to save all the code I create whilst learning arduino usage through [robocore's](robocore.net) basic arduino kit + tutorials.

I had already gone through about half of it before starting this repository, but since there was a long pause I decided to start from the beginning and document everything here.
