# Arduino basics
This repository is where I'm going to save all the code I create whilst learning arduino usage through [robocore's](robocore.net) basic arduino kit + tutorials.

I had already done about half of it before starting the repository, but since it was months before and I would have to go through everything again to remember how all of it works, I decided to save this is a nicely organized repository.
