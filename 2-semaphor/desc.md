# Semaphor project
This is a semaphor both for vehicles and for pedestrians. It's the first project in the series of tutorials that guide this repository.
## The code
I thought it would be really boring to just write every possible scenario by hand like the project's proposal suggests, so I made a simple state matrix that describes what each semaphor light should do and how long the state should last (in ms).

This also makes it a lot easier to make changes, though the code looks weirder.

I still kept the compiler directives for each LED's pin number so it looks a little better.
